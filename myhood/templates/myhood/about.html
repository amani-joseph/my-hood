		<p class="text-start">
               Neighbors around the world turn to My-hood daily to receive trusted
			information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world
			connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public
			services. We believe connecting with others is a universal human need.
			That truth, and the reality that neighborhoods are among the most
			important communities in our lives, have been guiding principles for
			Nextdoor since the beginning.

		<h4 class="fw-bold fst-italic" style="color: rgb(61, 43, 226);">Connecting the neighborhood</h4>
		<p class="text-start">
			We recognize that thriving communities are made up of the neighbors and
			organizations that build stronger, more vibrant, and resilient
			neighborhoods. Neighbors — Connect with the people you already wave to in
			your neighborhood, or those you have yet to meet. Businesses — Instantly
			reach your most valuable customers — your neighbors — and become a trusted
			part of the neighborhood. Nonprofits — Engage with the people who need you
			most and find support from donors nearby with features like Sell for Good.
			Public agencies — Share critical, real-time information directly at the
			neighborhood level. Large brands — Provide locally relevant products and
			services that improve neighbors’ daily lives.
